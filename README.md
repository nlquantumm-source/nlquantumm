👋 Hi, I'm Noah @nlquantumm-source. I'm a South Korean, doing research on materials applicable on Quantum Computer & CMOS quantum memory devices based on advanced spintronics.
👨‍💻 I'm self-taught in mathematics, & scientific computing.
✍️ My areas of work include: electron-beam lithography, nanodevice patterning, quantum hardware systems engineering, & materials integration.
👀 My interest is in optimizable quantum hardware engineering, nanofabrication engineering, quantum computation, & data-driven 3D modeling.
👨‍🔬 I'm a current Staff Researcher at UMN-TC, Minneapolis, Minnesota, working with @OJB-Quantum for several research paper publish on new materials on cryogenic magnetic RAM in nanofabrication facility (Cleanroom).
